Autonomous Insurance Claims Processing Agent

Overview
This project is a lightweight AI-based agent that processes FNOL (First Notice of Loss) insurance documents.
It extracts key information from PDF/text files, checks for missing or inconsistent data, and automatically routes the claim to the correct workflow.
The system is designed for quick automation of basic insurance claim triage.

Features
Extracts important claim fields from FNOL documents
Detects missing mandatory fields
Applies routing rules automatically
Flags suspicious or fraud-related descriptions
Outputs structured JSON result
Runs easily on Google Colab

Tech Stack
Python
Regex (re) – Text pattern extraction
pdfplumber – PDF text extraction
JSON – Structured output
Google Colab – Execution environment

Approach
1. Document Input
User uploads FNOL document (PDF or text file).

2. Text Extraction
PDF is converted into raw text using pdfplumber.

3. Field Extraction
Regex patterns are used to identify:
Policy Number
Date of Loss
Location
Description of Accident
Estimated Damage
Claim Type (if available)

4. Missing Field Detection
Checks which required fields are empty or not found.

5. Routing Logic
Rules applied:
Damage < 25,000 → Fast Track
Missing mandatory field → Manual Review
Keywords like fraud, staged, inconsistent → Investigation Flag
Injury claim → Specialist Queue
Otherwise → Standard Processing
            
6. JSON Output
Final result is returned in structured format:
{
  extractedFields: {},
  missingFields: [],
  recommendedRoute: "",
  reasoning: ""
}

Steps to Run (Google Colab)
Step 1 – Open Colab
Go to: https://colab.research.google.com

Step 2 – Install Dependency
!pip install pdfplumber

Step 3 – Upload FNOL PDF
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

Step 4 – Run the Script
Execute all provided Python cells in order:
Import libraries
Read PDF
Extract fields
Apply routing rules
Print JSON output
